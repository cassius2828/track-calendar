- Will connect entries to a data base and map through desired data from there
- Be sure to complete media queries / design for under 600px. The reason for the 3rd bracket breaking so soon is because the length of the word "Championship". There is a way to add automated hyphens to address this issue, but I did not implement that here
- Contact me if you have any question about this concept for redesigning the basic table for the page
